## Description

Single page application in Next.js. 

In addition to describing some of my projects, there is a micro-blog that I hope I will keep (after all, any self-respecting developer creates a blog platform or at least a page with posts before writing his first post about his beloved cat or cactus ðŸ˜‰).

Stack: Next (SSR and CSR), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, Next's fetch() API... CredentialsProvider and GoogleProvider signing in.
